# BLM Data Analysis

## Overview  
This project investigates the relationship between police killings, racial demographics, and socioeconomic factors in the United States. It provides actionable insights into police brutality, focusing on reforms to enhance fairness, accountability, and transparency. The findings support the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement.

## Research Questions  
- Does race affect police brutality?  
- Is there a relationship between poverty and police brutality?  
- Can body cameras reduce police brutality?  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Sources**:  
   - Police shootings dataset  
   - Household income data  
   - Racial distribution data  

2. **ETL Process**:  
   - Data cleaning using Excel (removal of missing and erroneous values).  
   - Data integration in Tableau for visualization and analysis.  

3. **Analysis**:  
   - Trends in police killings since 2015.  
   - Correlations between killings, racial demographics, and income levels.  
   - Impact of body cameras on reducing fatal incidents.  

## Key Findings  
- No evidence of intentional racial or income-based targeting.  
- States with high killings (e.g., California, Texas, Florida, Arizona) reflect demographic patterns.  
- Body cameras significantly reduce fatal encounters.  

## Recommendations  
1. **Mandatory Body Cameras**: Equip all officers with body cameras to increase accountability.  
2. **Localized Reforms**: Implement targeted solutions for regional disparities in police-citizen interactions.  
3. **Transparent Policies**: Establish clear regulations emphasizing fairness and accountability.  
4. **Advocacy and Awareness**: Promote these reforms in political campaigns to address public concerns.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Excel**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and analysis.
